  I enjoy geeking out on cool tech. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather, these are the items you can find me using regularly
  </p>
  <h2>Hardware</h2>
  <ul>
    <%- current_page.data.hardware.each do |hardware| %>
      <li>
        <b><%= hardware.title %>:</b> <%= hardware.content.join(', ') %>
      </li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
  <h2>Software</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Terminal:</b> Ghostty & my homebrewed terminal config. When I first started at Hashrocket, I made a point to learn as much as I could from dotmatrix - an open source terminal config for workstations. After tinkering for a few years, I've started to settle on a config on my own. However a good portion of the config files still come from dotmatrix.
    <li>
      <b>Text Editor:</b> Big VIM guy here (lol), but I've been using NVIM most recently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Other:</b> <%= current_page.data.apps.join(', ') %>
